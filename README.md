# SolarUsersTable

Test task for Angular Front-end developer position

## Task description

Create a table to display users from a local JSON file. Implement UI CRUD. Extra features - filtering, 
extra columns for avatar and summary. 

## Libraries

### NgZorro
Main components library used for all basic components in the project. I've decided not to spend time on layout
and concentrate on the logic.

### Akita

Because briefing itself was quite open I've decided to create some "fake back-end requests" and react 
to user actions. Akita is my favorite way to create such things

### NgXf

My day-to-day helper made by Angular Fox - russian Angular influencer and just a cool guy.

## Overview

Overall in this project I was trying to make table as close as possible to the production yet I didn't 
spent much time on things like styling and responsiveness. I've tried to implement a few things I've never did on
an actual project and that was quite interesting experience as well.
